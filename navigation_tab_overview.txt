NAVIGATION AND TAB OVERVIEW
===========================

This document outlines the navigation structure and tab implementations in the RMSVS Tenant Management System.

## NAVIGATION STRUCTURE

The Filament admin panel organizes resources into navigation groups. Each resource appears in the sidebar navigation with an icon, label, and optional sort order.

### Navigation Groups

       - Label: "Scanners"
       - Permission: view scanner
     
     * Transit Log
       - Icon: heroicon-o-key
       - Label: "Transit Log"
       - Permission: view transit

#### 3. Settings Group
   - Purpose: System configuration and management
   - Resources:
     * Users (Sort: 1)
       - Icon: heroicon-o-users
       - Label: "Users"
       - Permission: view user

### Landlord Resources (Super Admin)
   - Tenants
     - Icon: heroicon-o-rectangle-stack
     - Group: "Settings"
     - Permission: Landlord guard authentication required

## TAB IMPLEMENTATIONS

Tabs provide filtering capabilities within resource list pages.

### Guest Resource - List Guests Page
   - Location: app/Filament/Resources/Tenant/GuestResource/Pages/ListGuests.php
   - Tabs:
     * Active Tab
       - Badge: "Active"
       - Filter: is_active = 'active'
     
     * Inactive Tab
       - Label: "InActive"
       - Filter: is_active = 'inactive'

## PERMISSION-BASED NAVIGATION

All resources implement permission-based navigation visibility through the `shouldRegisterNavigation()` method. This ensures that:
- Users only see navigation items they have permission to access
- The navigation is dynamic based on user roles
- Security is enforced at the navigation level

Each resource checks:
- Tenant guard authentication: `Auth::guard('tenant')->check()`
- Specific permission: `Auth::guard('tenant')->user()->can('permission_name')`

## ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### ✓ Issue 1: ManualScanPage Mislabeling [FIXED]
**Location:** app/Filament/Pages/ManualScanPage.php
**Problem:**
- navigationLabel was "Guest Requests" (incorrect)
- navigationGroup was "Guest Management" (inconsistent with other groups)
- Created a separate navigation group with only one item

**Resolution:**
- Changed navigationLabel to "Manual Scan"
- Changed navigationGroup to "Scans" to group with other scanning functionality
- Updated navigationSort to 3 to place it logically in the Scans group
- Updated page title to "Manual Scan"

### ✓ Issue 2: Navigation Group Consistency [FIXED]
**Problem:** The "Guest Management" group only contained one item (ManualScanPage)

**Resolution:** Consolidated into "Scans" group for better organization and consistency

## TESTING REQUIREMENTS

To verify the navigation and tab implementation is working:

1. Test navigation visibility with different user roles
2. Verify tab filtering in Guest list page
3. Confirm permission-based navigation hiding
4. Test all navigation links lead to correct pages
5. Verify sort order of navigation items
6. Test ManualScanPage functionality

✓ Navigation labels are accurate and descriptive
✓ Tab implementation provides proper filtering
✓ Permission-based access control is enforced
✓ Code quality standards are met
✓ All identified issues have been resolved

The system provides a well-organized, role-based navigation structure that enables users to efficiently access the features they need based on their permissions.
