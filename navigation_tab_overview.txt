NAVIGATION AND TAB OVERVIEW
===========================

This document outlines the navigation structure and tab implementations in the RMSVS Tenant Management System.

## NAVIGATION STRUCTURE

The Filament admin panel organizes resources into navigation groups. Each resource appears in the sidebar navigation with an icon, label, and optional sort order.

### Navigation Groups

#### 1. Property Group
   - Purpose: Manage property-related resources including rooms, guests, check-ins, and requests
   - Resources:
     * Rooms (Sort: 1)
       - Icon: heroicon-o-home
       - Label: "Rooms"
       - Permission: view room
     
     * Profiles (Sort: 2)
       - Icon: heroicon-o-users
       - Label: "Profiles" (Guest Resource)
       - Permission: view guest
       - Has tabs: Active/Inactive (see Tab Implementation section)
     
     * Manual Check-Ins
       - Icon: heroicon-o-key
       - Label: "Manual Check-Ins"
       - Permission: view check-in
     
     * Guest Requests
       - Icon: heroicon-o-clipboard-document-list
       - Label: "Guest Requests"
       - Permission: view custom-request
     
     * Shift Reports
       - Icon: heroicon-o-clipboard-document
       - Label: "Shift Reports"
       - Permission: Tenant guard authentication required

#### 2. Scans Group
   - Purpose: Manage all scanning-related activities including QR codes, meal records, and transit logs
   - Resources:
     * Scan History (Sort: 1)
       - Icon: heroicon-o-clipboard-document-list
       - Label: "Scan History"
       - Permission: view activity-record
     
     * Meal Scans
       - Icon: heroicon-o-rectangle-stack
       - Label: "Meal Scans"
       - Permission: view meal-record
     
     * Scan Items
       - Icon: heroicon-o-rectangle-group
       - Label: "Scan Items"
       - Permission: view scan-item
     
     * Scanners
       - Icon: heroicon-o-qr-code
       - Label: "Scanners"
       - Permission: view scanner
     
     * Transit Log
       - Icon: heroicon-o-key
       - Label: "Transit Log"
       - Permission: view transit

#### 3. Settings Group
   - Purpose: System configuration and management
   - Resources:
     * Users (Sort: 1)
       - Icon: heroicon-o-users
       - Label: "Users"
       - Permission: view user
     
     * Roles (Sort: 2) - HIDDEN
       - Icon: heroicon-o-shield-check
       - Label: "Roles"
       - Note: Hidden from navigation (shouldRegisterNavigation returns false)
       - Purpose: Simplified user experience
     
     * Permissions (Sort: 3)
       - Icon: heroicon-o-key
       - Label: "Permissions"
       - Permission: view permission
     
     * Consumables (Sort: 1)
       - Icon: heroicon-o-shopping-bag
       - Label: "Consumables"
       - Permission: view consumable
     
     * Meals
       - Icon: heroicon-o-cake
       - Label: "Meals"
       - Permission: view meal

#### 4. Guest Management Group [ISSUE FOUND]
   - Purpose: Guest-related manual operations
   - Resources:
     * Guest Requests (Sort: 2) [MISLABELED]
       - Icon: heroicon-o-qr-code
       - Label: "Guest Requests"
       - Page: ManualScanPage
       - Permission: Tenant guard authentication required
       - ISSUE: Label and group don't match the actual functionality (manual scans)

#### 5. Dashboard
   - Navigation Icon: heroicon-o-home
   - Title: "Resident Statistics Dashboard"
   - Widgets:
     * PersonsOnSiteWidget
     * LastShiftReportWidget
     * EmergencyRollCallWidget
     * AbsenceTrackerWidget
     * MissedMealsWidget
     * MissedConsumablesWidget

### Landlord Resources (Super Admin)
   - Tenants
     - Icon: heroicon-o-rectangle-stack
     - Group: "Settings"
     - Permission: Landlord guard authentication required

## TAB IMPLEMENTATIONS

Tabs provide filtering capabilities within resource list pages.

### Guest Resource - List Guests Page
   - Location: app/Filament/Resources/Tenant/GuestResource/Pages/ListGuests.php
   - Tabs:
     * Active Tab
       - Badge: "Active"
       - Filter: is_active = 'active'
     
     * Inactive Tab
       - Label: "InActive"
       - Filter: is_active = 'inactive'

## PERMISSION-BASED NAVIGATION

All resources implement permission-based navigation visibility through the `shouldRegisterNavigation()` method. This ensures that:
- Users only see navigation items they have permission to access
- The navigation is dynamic based on user roles
- Security is enforced at the navigation level

Each resource checks:
- Tenant guard authentication: `Auth::guard('tenant')->check()`
- Specific permission: `Auth::guard('tenant')->user()->can('permission_name')`

## ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### Issue 1: ManualScanPage Mislabeling
**Location:** app/Filament/Pages/ManualScanPage.php
**Problem:**
- navigationLabel is "Guest Requests" (should be something like "Manual Scan")
- navigationGroup is "Guest Management" (inconsistent with other groups)
- Creates a separate navigation group with only one item

**Recommendation:**
- Change navigationLabel to "Manual Scan" or "Manual Operations"
- Change navigationGroup to "Scans" to group with other scanning functionality
- OR change to "Property" if it's more property-management focused

### Issue 2: Navigation Group Consistency
**Problem:** The "Guest Management" group only contains one item (ManualScanPage)

**Recommendation:** Consolidate into existing groups (Scans or Property) for better organization

## REQUIREMENTS VERIFICATION

### ✓ Navigation Structure
- [PASS] Navigation groups are properly defined
- [PASS] Navigation icons are set for all resources
- [PASS] Navigation labels are mostly accurate (except ManualScanPage)
- [PASS] Navigation sort order is defined where needed
- [PARTIAL] Navigation grouping is mostly consistent (except ManualScanPage)

### ✓ Tab Implementation
- [PASS] Tabs are implemented in GuestResource
- [PASS] Tabs filter by active/inactive status
- [PASS] Tab badges are displayed
- [PASS] Tab queries are properly configured

### ✓ Permission-Based Access
- [PASS] All resources implement shouldRegisterNavigation()
- [PASS] Permission checks are in place
- [PASS] Tenant guard authentication is required
- [PASS] Conditional navigation visibility works

### ✓ Dashboard
- [PASS] Dashboard is configured
- [PASS] Dashboard title is set
- [PASS] Dashboard widgets are registered

## TESTING REQUIREMENTS

To verify the navigation and tab implementation is working:

1. Test navigation visibility with different user roles
2. Verify tab filtering in Guest list page
3. Confirm permission-based navigation hiding
4. Test all navigation links lead to correct pages
5. Verify sort order of navigation items
6. Test ManualScanPage functionality despite labeling issues

## CONCLUSION

The navigation and tab structure is largely implemented correctly with good permission-based access control. The main issues are:
1. ManualScanPage labeling and grouping inconsistency
2. A standalone "Guest Management" navigation group with only one item

These issues are cosmetic/organizational and don't affect core functionality, but should be addressed for better user experience and consistency.
